## Asynchronous and Synchronous Programming

Synchronous programming follows a set of sequences, which means that the operations are run one at a time. When one operation is being executed, all of the other operations are blocked to wait for that particular operation to finish. 

With asynchronous programming, multiple related operations can run simulataneously without having to wait for other tasks to complete. This method is a multithreaded model that is most applicable to networking and communications.

## Event-Driven Programming

With event-driven programming, the code will be executed asynchronously. In creating a web page, the majority of the time, users will have the ability to execute events such as click, mouseover, contextmenu, submit, input, and many more. Applying event-drive programming, will allow the code to be run when an event happens. This will make your web page to be more interactive. 

The basic component of an Event-Drive Program are a call back function( called an event handler) is called when an event is triggered, and a n event loop that listens for event triggers and calls the coreesponding event handler dor that event.

## Implementation of Asynchronous Programming in AJAX

To use asynchronous programming in AJAX, you can use jQuery's ajax() function. It will call the backend function asynchronously. 


## Implementation

1. create view to return data in JSON from, add path and do AJAX GET method

2. Create add task with modal form and do AJAX POST

3. Create view to add new task, add path and connect the form to the path
